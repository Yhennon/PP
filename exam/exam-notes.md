# The exam itself

***The exam is held on 13 January 2023.***

On the Moodle page, there is a [series of videos](https://www.moodle.aau.dk/course/view.php?id=48271#coursecontentcollapse1), which goes through an example of how an exam looks like.
As the exam approaches, start watching these videos to get a grasp on what you might expect.

## Learning goals for the exam based on moodle descriptions of lectures

## Session 1 Learning goals

- To be able to explain the notion of a function in the functional programming paradigm in a precise way
- To be able to install the Glasgow Haskell compiler and use it with a simple programming environment
- To be able to edit, load and use simple Haskell scripts

### Session 2 Learning goals

- To be able to explain the notion of a function in the functional programming paradigm in a precise way
- To understand the central points in the history of functional programming
- To be able to write simple definitions in Haskell
- To understand and be able to apply simple aspects of Haskell syntax: Definitions, comments, the layout rule and where declarations in definitions

### Session 3 Learning goals

Haskell:

- To be able to explain and use the central notions of types in Haskell â€“ basic types, list types, function types and tuple types
- To be able to explain and use curried and uncurried functions and how these notions relate to higher-order functions
- To be able to explain and use the notion of type classes
- To be able to explain the notions of polymorphism and overloading (parametric and ad hoc-polymorphism), the difference between them and the relationship to type classes

The theoretical foundations:

- To be able to explain and use the syntax and reduction semantics of the pure lambda-calculus
- To be able to explain why renaming of bound variables is a necessary notion

### Session 4 Learning goals

- To understand the syntax and informal semantics of conditional expressions and guards and to be able to use these when programming in Haskell
- To understand and be able to use the different forms of patterns and pattern matching when programming in Haskell
- To understand anonymous functions (lambda expressions) in Haskell
- To understand the notion of list comprehension and how guards are used in comprehensions
- To be able to use list comprehension for defining functions in Haskell
- To understand how all these notions can be used in when building larger programs and to be able to apply this understanding when programming in Haskell

### Session 6 Learning goals
